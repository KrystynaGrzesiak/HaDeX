## Choose `out` time for calculations

This value is treated as an approximation of a fully deuterated sample for the experimental calculation type. If the control in Settings panel is chosen, this control is a reference timepoint for all states. Otherwise, measurements are compared with measurement in the same state in chosen timepoint. 

Be careful with using this option if you do not have measurements for all states in all timpoints.

## Test indicator

Confidence intervals on differential butterfly plot can affect readibility. They can be shown or not, as the user prefers.

The confidence intervals are calculated based on Houde test. For more information see the documentation.

Confidence intervals indicate if the measurement is statistically significant. If the result of the measurement is above 
confidence interval on 98% confidence level, it means that for 98% the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between two states) can be rejected.

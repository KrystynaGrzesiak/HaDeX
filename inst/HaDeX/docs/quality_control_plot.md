## Quality control

This plot shows the change in the uncertainty of deuteration levels as a function of maximal exchange control. It considers only experimental fractional values, where maximal exchange control is used. It presents the efect that selected maximal exchage control has on the data.

On the X axis there are time points of measurement that are used as maximal exchange control. The axis is in logaritmic scale due to the readability of the plot. 

On the Y axis there is averaged uncertainty for all the peptides for the time points of measurement smaller that the maximal exchange control. 

If the experiment is performed correctly, the values of the plot should be smaller with the increase of incubation time for maximal exchange control.

## Choose `out` time for calculations

This value is treated as a maximum measured deuterated value for experimental calculation type. If the control in Settins panel is chosen, 
all of the states are compared with this control. Otherwise, they are compared with measurement in the same state in chosen timepoint. Be careful with using this option if you don't have measurement for all of the states in the same timpoints.
